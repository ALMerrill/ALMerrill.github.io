Location: Redacted

Here's what I'm up to right now.

- I work at a startup in called DeliciousAI
- We recently bought a house and we're about to move to Redacted
- I just put together this site, and I have a goal to organize all my thoughts better, and have one central location to store all of my notes, ideas, snippits, etc.
- Just added redacted because I don't feel like commiting information right now, haha
