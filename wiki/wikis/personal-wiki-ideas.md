# Implementation

- https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/#how-it-all-works
- Joplin: https://github.com/ylc395/joplin-plugin-pages-publisher
- keep an eye on bangle.io. If built in git syncing through api is implemented, I could try it with mobile as a note app
  - https://github.com/bangle-io/bangle-io/issues/223


# TODO

- [ ] Figure out a good way to use joplin to edit files, and then easily export them and update the repo to republish to the site
