This is what posts will look like in general. However, I am going to be focusing more on the wiki side of the site than the post side as of right now.

## For my reference
Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
